## A. CURATION RATIONALE 

Bornholmsk NLP didn't exist; this data attempts to remedy that. The goal was to build as much as we could with the scant resources available. There's digitised Bornholmsk text, scrapes over various web pages, transcriptions of a bilingual text, digital phrasebooks, and aligned Danish-Bornholmsk text. Every bit of digital Bornholmsk we could find at the time was included.
