# Bornholmsk

Language processing resources and tools for Bornholmsk, a language spoken on the island of Bornholm, with roots in Danish and closely related to Scanian. Includes corpora, word vectors, and parallel Bornholmsk/Danish text.

The language resources are in `resources/`. Processed corpora are in the top directory, including the parallel text for machine translation (`parallel.*`). The CC embeddings are 300-dimension and aligned with the FastText multilingual space using the algorithm in `align.py`. The `.clean` corpus skips some less-canonical resources. The `resources/` directory also contains some source PDFs, including a good scan of Kuhre's Sansager and Espersen's 1908 Ordbog (both public domain). The Kuhre is split into chapters and aligned, tidied Danish and Bornholmsk. The split-chapter versions have had some slight edits to ensure 1:1 sentence alignment. There are also a few selected works by Otto Lunch. Note that the `resources/` contains also some Danish gazetteers, mostly for anchoring the machine translation system, which can otherwise be ignored.
